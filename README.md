# Pakistans-regression-on-WDI-PENN-data
The data was taken from World Bank's World Development Index and PENN World Table, it has been filtered for Pakistan and the missing values were imputed using Median

I investigated Okun's Law in the context of Pakistan using empirical analysis. 
I gathered and cleaned data from the Penn World Table and the World Development Indicators, 
looking at things like unemployment, GDP, and human capital. I looked at the patterns of these variables, 
calculated their rates of increase, made scatterplots to investigate the relationship between unemployment and GDP growth, 
and carried out a multivariate regression to comprehend the effects of different variables on GDP growth. 
This thorough analysis contributes to a better understanding of economic phenomena by offering insights into the dynamics of Pakistan's economy and labor market.
